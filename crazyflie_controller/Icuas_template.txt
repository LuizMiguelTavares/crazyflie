\section{PROCEDURE FOR PAPER SUBMISSION}

\subsection{Selecting a Template (Heading 2)}

First, confirm that you have the correct template for your paper size. This template has been tailored for output on the US-letter paper size. 
It may be used for A4 paper size if the paper size setting is suitably modified.

\subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}

The template is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin in this template measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. Please do not revise any of the current designations

\section{MATH}

Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a separate text file. Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been formatted and styled. Do not use hard tabs, and limit use of hard returns to only one return at the end of a paragraph. Do not add any kind of pagination anywhere in the paper. Do not number text heads-the template will do that for you.

Finally, complete content and organizational editing before formatting. Please take note of the following items when proofreading spelling and grammar:

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms} Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, sc, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Units}

\begin{itemize}

\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as Ò3.5-inch disk driveÓ.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ÒWb/m2Ó or Òwebers per square meterÓ, not Òwebers/m2Ó.  Spell out units when they appear in text: Ò. . . a few henriesÓ, not Ò. . . a few HÓ.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: Ò0.25Ó, not Ò.25Ó. Use Òcm3Ó, not ÒccÓ. (bullet list)

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Equations}

The equations are an exception to the prescribed specifications of this template. You will need to determine whether or not your equation should be typed using either the Times New Roman or the Symbol font (please no other font). To create multileveled equations, it may be necessary to treat the equation as a graphic and insert it into the text after your paper is styled. Number equations consecutively. Equation numbers, within parentheses, are to position flush right, as in (1), using a right tab stop. To make your equations more compact, you may use the solidus ( / ), the exp function, or appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a sentence, as in

$$
\alpha + \beta = \chi \eqno{(1)}
$$

Note that the equation is centered using a center tab stop. Be sure that the symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following the equation. Use Ò(1)Ó, not ÒEq. (1)Ó or Òequation (1)Ó, except at the beginning of a sentence: ÒEquation (1) is . . .Ó

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}
\begin{itemize}


\item The word ÒdataÓ is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum ?0, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ÒoÓ.
\item In American English, commas, semi-/colons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ÒinsetÓ, not an ÒinsertÓ. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ÒalternatelyÓ (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ÒessentiallyÓ to mean ÒapproximatelyÓ or ÒeffectivelyÓ.
\item In your paper title, if the words Òthat usesÓ can accurately replace the word ÒusingÓ, capitalize the ÒuÓ; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ÒaffectÓ and ÒeffectÓ, ÒcomplementÓ and ÒcomplimentÓ, ÒdiscreetÓ and ÒdiscreteÓ, ÒprincipalÓ and ÒprincipleÓ.
\item Do not confuse ÒimplyÓ and ÒinferÓ.
\item The prefix ÒnonÓ is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ÒetÓ in the Latin abbreviation Òet al.Ó.
\item The abbreviation Òi.e.Ó means Òthat isÓ, and the abbreviation Òe.g.Ó means Òfor exampleÓ.

\end{itemize}


\section{USING THE TEMPLATE}

Use this sample document as your LaTeX source file to create your document. Save this file as {\bf root.tex}. You have to make sure to use the cls file that came with this distribution. If you use a different style file, you cannot expect to get required margins. Note also that when you are creating your out PDF file, the source file is only part of the equation. {\it Your \TeX\ $\rightarrow$ PDF filter determines the output file size. Even if you make all the specifications to output a letter file in the source - if your filter is set to produce A4, you will only get A4 output. }

It is impossible to account for all possible situation, one would encounter using \TeX. If you are using multiple \TeX\ files you must make sure that the ``MAIN`` source file is called root.tex - this is particularly important if your conference is using PaperPlaza's built in \TeX\ to PDF conversion tool.

\subsection{Headings, etc}

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads should be introduced. Styles named ÒHeading 1Ó, ÒHeading 2Ó, ÒHeading 3Ó, and ÒHeading 4Ó are prescribed.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Positioning Figures and Tables: Place figures and tables at the top and bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation ÒFig. 1Ó, even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{An Example of a Table}
\label{table_example}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
\hline
One & Two\\
\hline
Three & Four\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}


   \begin{figure}[thpb]
      \centering
      \framebox{\parbox{3in}{We suggest that you use a text box to insert a graphic (which is ideally a 300 dpi TIFF or EPS file, with all fonts embedded) because, in an document, this method is somewhat more stable than directly inserting a picture.
}}
      %\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{figurefile}
      \caption{Inductance of oscillation winding on amorphous
       magnetic core versus DC bias magnetic field}
      \label{figurelabel}
   \end{figure}
   

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity ÒMagnetizationÓ, or ÒMagnetization, MÓ, not just ÒMÓ. If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write ÒMagnetization (A/m)Ó or ÒMagnetization {A[m(1)]}Ó, not just ÒA/mÓ. Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write ÒTemperature (K)Ó, not ÒTemperature/K.Ó

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

The conclusion section should be included here. Although a conclusion may review the main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest applications and extensions. 

%\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.

To validate the proposed control strategy, real-world
experiments were run using a crazyflie quadrotor to follow a predetermined trajectory given by:

\begin{align}
x &= x_{\text{radius}} \cdot \cos(\omega \cdot t), \\
y &= y_{\text{radius}} \cdot \sin(\omega \cdot t), \\
z &= z_{\text{desired}} + 2 \cdot z_{\text{radius}} \cdot \cos(2 \cdot \omega \cdot t), \\
v_x &= -x_{\text{radius}} \cdot \omega \cdot \sin(\omega \cdot t), \\
v_y &= y_{\text{radius}} \cdot \omega \cdot \cos(\omega \cdot t), \\
v_z &= -2 \cdot z_{\text{radius}} \cdot \omega \cdot \sin(2 \cdot \omega \cdot t),
\end{align}

\noindent Using \(\omega\) as \(\sqrt{1.0}\).

The control method run in an offboard station, at a rate of 30 Hz,
acquiring the poses of the drone through
an OptiTrack motion capture system configured with twelve
cameras, and computing the reference control signals that are
sent to the robots via ROS.

Two experiments were made with the two control strategies mentioned in section \ref{sec:control_framework}, the one that uses the LQR and the othe is the LQG.
For the LQR control the reference velocities and the velocities used by the controller position will be taken directly by the optitrack system 
The position and velocity used on the LQR  come directly from the optitrack sytem
With regard to the validating experiments, five trans-
portation tasks were executed to test the proposed algo-
rithms. In every experiment, the control of the payload
position, xbar , and orientation, ηbar , is the main concern.
Hence, following the control structure presented in Figure 3,
the desired payload state is the task planner input, from
which qp,des and ˙qp,des are obtained using (2), and qc,des =
[ψbar,des θbar,des L]>. The payload roll angle, φbar , is not
possible to be controlled using our proposal. Also, the yaw
angle for the vehicles are not considered, because the
quadrotor is an omnidirectional vehicle, as mentioned in
Section IV.
As for the gains adopted for the controller of each quadro-
tor in the experiments discussed ahead, they are the diago-
nal matrices κ1 = diag(2.5, 2.5, 3.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0), κ2 =
diag(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0), κD = diag(2.7, 2.7, 3.0),
and κ2 = 10−3diag(1.0, 0.1, 1.0, 0.1, 2.0, 5.0).

\section{Introduction}
Provide an overview of your research, including the background, problem statement, and objectives.

\section{Literature Review}
Discuss previous work in your area of research, highlighting the gap your study aims to fill.

\section{Experimental Setup}
This section describes the setup and methodology of the experiments conducted to validate the proposed control strategies for UAVs, specifically using a Crazyflie quadrotor.

\subsection{Objective}
The primary objective of our experiments was to validate the effectiveness of Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control strategies in guiding a quadrotor along a predefined trajectory.

\subsection{Quadrotor Test Platform}
We utilized the Crazyflie 2.1 quadrotor as our test platform due to its lightweight design, open-source software, and compatibility with various sensors and motion capture systems.

\subsection{Trajectory Design}
The desired trajectory for the quadrotor was defined mathematically by the following equations:
\begin{align*}
x(t) &= x_{\text{radius}} \cdot \cos(\omega t), \\
y(t) &= y_{\text{radius}} \cdot \sin(\omega t), \\
z(t) &= z_{\text{desired}} + 2 \cdot z_{\text{radius}} \cdot \cos(2 \omega t),
\end{align*}
where $\omega = \sqrt{1.0}$ represents the angular frequency of the trajectory.

\subsection{Control Strategy Implementation}
We implemented two control strategies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{LQR Control}: Directly uses positions from the OptiTrack system and calculates velocities using Euler's method.
    \item \textbf{LQG Control}: Utilizes positions and velocities estimated by an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), introducing Gaussian noise to simulate real-world conditions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Acquisition and Processing}
The OptiTrack motion capture system, equipped with twelve cameras, was used to acquire the drone's pose data at a 30 Hz frequency. This data was processed by an offboard computer running ROS to compute and send control commands to the quadrotor.

\subsection{Experimental Procedure}
Detail the step-by-step procedure of the experiments, including the setup of the motion capture system, calibration of the quadrotor, and execution of control strategies.
