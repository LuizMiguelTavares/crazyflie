# crazyflie_msgs Package

The `crazyflie_msgs` package is dedicated to defining custom message types for the Crazyflie drone, enabling specialized communication within the ROS ecosystem tailored to the drone's operations. This package is pivotal for the standardized exchange of data specific to the functionalities and telemetry of the Crazyflie drone.

## Overview

This package includes custom ROS messages designed to facilitate the structured communication of log data from the Crazyflie drone. It ensures that data is efficiently packaged and transmitted within the ROS framework, supporting the development of robust and responsive drone control systems.

## Key Components

- **CrazyflieLog.msg**: A custom message designed specifically for transmitting log data from the Crazyflie drone. This message allows for the structured and standardized communication of various telemetry and operational parameters, making it an essential tool for monitoring and controlling the drone's behavior.

## Usage

To incorporate the `crazyflie_msgs` into your project, ensure that your package lists `crazyflie_msgs` as a dependency in both the `CMakeLists.txt` and `package.xml` files. This inclusion allows you to import and use the custom message types in your ROS nodes, facilitating the exchange of data pertinent to the Crazyflie drone's operation.

## Building the Package

Place the `crazyflie_msgs` package within the `src` directory of your catkin workspace. Then, from the root of your catkin workspace, execute `catkin_make` to build the package and generate the necessary message types for use in your ROS environment.
